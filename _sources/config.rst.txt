Valhalla Config and Gumpf
*************************

Various configuration files and stuff for Valhalla. These are all generated by
the script *test.sh* in the root folder of this repository. The only one that is
actuall needed after that script has run is *valhalla.json*.

- **valhalla.json**: Valhalla configuration. Would usually be produced by running
  *test.sh* in the root of the cvts repo.

- **valhalla_tiles**: Valhalla tiles. Would usually be produced by running
  *test.sh* in the root of the cvts repo.

- **valhalla_tiles.tar**: tar of *valhalla\_tiles*. Would usually be produced
  by running *test.sh* in the root of the cvts repo.

- **vietnam-latest.osm.pbf**: 'raw' OSM data. May be downloaded when running
  *test.sh* in the root of the cvts repo. However, we just symlink to a
  definitive version for now.
