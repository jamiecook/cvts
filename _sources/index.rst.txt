Glossary
========

This glossary is tuned to how we use the terms within CVTS, which is often
different on how they are used more generally.

.. glossary::

    geometry
        A spatial object (at present, a Polygon or MultiPolygon) on which some
        set of observations are made.

    geography
        A set of :term:`geometries<geometry>` that specify regionalisations of
        interest. see :ref:`here<geographies-data>` for a description of what is
        required in this package.
